```bash
Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java.
